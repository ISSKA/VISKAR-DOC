Terminology
=============
Key terms for Visual KARSYS are defined here to ensure we share the same understanding of the terms. This is also important for the documentation and user guide. A brief description of the *meaning* of each term is sufficient - the details of the website layout belong elsewhere.

Key terms
----------

* **Project**: The "unit of work" a user works in. A project contains metadata such as name, location and size and the (hydro)geological data for each KARSYS model. One project results in one 3D model.

* **DEM**: Digital Elevation Model

* **Map**: An image of the specified area, may be a regular geographical map, geological, or other. A map covers the entire area specified by the project's coordinates.

* **Surface model**: The 3D rendering of the DEM, generally overlayed with a map texture.

* **3D model**: The resulting model or mesh that was generated based on the surface model, 

* **Point of interest**: A point in the model which represents a spring, a cave, a sink, ...

* **Groundwater body**: A water flooded area based from a point of interest in a given unit


Website areas
---------------

* **Welcome** page : "Static" area of the website providing an overview of what KARSYS is and presenting Visual KARSYS features in an appealing and easily accessible way.

* **Dashboard**: User-centric area where user details are displayed, along with an overview of their projects. User can view and edit profile details here.

* **Project list** : Overview of a user's projects along with a brief summary of each (name, description, location)

* **Project details**: Presents general metadata like reference system, size, date created, etc..., a view of the data linked to this project, and a **progress map**

* **Progress map** shows each of the five models of the KARSYS method and shows the current status/progress on each model. From here, users can add/edit the data for each model.

* **3D viewer**: The interface in which the current state of the project is visualised. It presents the user with the surface model (DEM+map) and cross-sections, the 3D model, as well as any other types of 3D objects associated with the project.
