# Introduction
## What is Visual KARSYS
Visual KARSYS is a software platform dedicated to karst groundwater management.

Visual KARSYS offers a series of tools for assessing aquifer geometries and groundwater flow-systems.

Visual KARSYS is made available for scientists, engineers, managers and stakeholders facing environmental issues in karst environments: groundwater resources exploitation and protection, civil engineering projects, geothermal heat probes, Natural hazards, waste deposits, etc.

## How does it work
Through 5 different steps, Visual KARSYS allow the user to create an explicit 3D model of the karst aquifer and of the groundwater of a studied area.

These 5 steps are :
- Setup
  - Set the dimensions of the project
  - Create the basic elements of the project (Maps, Crosssections, Drillholes, ...)
  - Visualize the elements of the project
- Hydrostratigraphy
  - Create the different series and units of the project
- Geology
  - Apply geodata to your elements
  - Process and generate the 3D model
- Groundwater
  - Create point of interests (springs, sinks, caves, ...)
  - Generate the ground water bodies
  - Visualize the whole scheme
- Flow paths & catchments
  - Create flow path on the map
  - Create catchments and see their behaviours

## Output page
Final step of the process which represents the whole idea of Visual KARSYS : everything the user has done in the different steps are visible here.
The user can then see the whole model and cut 'hypothetical' slices in the model and the website will calculate them. The same is possible for 'hypothetical' drillholes.

## Animation page
The animation page allow the user to visualize and animate water flow (rain and others) in the model and see the influence.
