# Database
The project Visual Karsys is not the only web app the ISSKA is thinking of, a new application named Fracsys is about to be created. 

Multiple options have been thought and the "META" solution has been decided.

The idea is to create a "ISSKAVerse" where a main platform will lead to different applications (Karsys, Fracsys, ...). Only one 'ISSKA' account will be needed.

For this to work, the whole database needs to be reworked.

This is but an hypothetical solution, but this would be the main idea.

## Visual Karsys
Furthermore, the database currently used by the web application visual karsys is not optimized at all. There are multiple redundances and some really bad table designs.

The whole database might need to be reworked as well.

And with this rework.. backend and frontend as well
.
