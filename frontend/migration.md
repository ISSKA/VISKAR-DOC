# Migration
The frontend migration is divised in two parts :
- Backend ; The services linked to the old scala part need to be adjusted, optimised and corrected
- Frontend ; The styling of the components are currently made with bootstrap, the point of this migration is to change the style with [tailwindcss](./ui-design.md)
